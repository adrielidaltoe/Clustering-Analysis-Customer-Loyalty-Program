# Select Customers to Participate the Loyalty Program of a Retailer Using Clustering Analysis

#### Author: Adrieli Dal'To√©

## Business Problem
UK Retailer sells gifts primarily on the online platform. The company knows that customers who make a purchase consume directly for themselves, but there are small businesses that buy in bulk and sell to other customers through the retail outlet channel.

The company wants to create a loyalty program for high-value customers. In this context, a high-value customer is known to contribute with a significant quote of the company's revenue. How UK Retailer can select the customers to be part of the loyalty program?

## Proposed solution
This problem can be solved using a segmentation strategy to group customers into categories according to characteristics shared among each other. This approach is known as clustering analysis. In this specific problem, the company is looking for a value-based segmentation to differentiate customers by the value they add to the business.

Once the clusters are known, the company can create the loyalty program for high-value customers. However, this knowledge can also be used to understand the customer needs, personalize the relationship and focus the marketing efforts, which can boost the sales in all customer groups. A truth well established nowadays is that the acquisition of new customers is much more expensive than efforts to maintain the current customers. Thus understanding your customers and their needs is crucial to the business profitability in long run.

The solution will be developed following the steps:

1. Data understanding and cleaning
2. Data preparation
 - Feature engineering: What features are important to separate customers into distinct groups?
 - Outliers treatment
 - Feature analysis and correlation
 - Standardizing Features
3. Modeling
 - Select algorithms
 - Identify the right number of customer segments
4. Evaluate the models
 - Identify the clustering algorithm that gives maximum accuracy and explains robust clusters.

With this project, it is intended to gather information to answer these questions:

1. Who are the eligible customers for the program?
2. How many customers compose the group?
3. What are the main characteristics of the group?
4. What is the percentage of the revenue contribution?
5. What is this group's revenue expectation for the coming months?
6. What are the conditions for a person to be eligible for the program?
7. What are the conditions for a person to be removed from the program?
8. What is the guarantee that the Insiders program is better than the rest of the base?
9. What actions can the marketing team take to increase revenue?
